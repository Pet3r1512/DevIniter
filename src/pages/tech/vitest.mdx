## Simple Test

In this example, we will write a very simple test in order to verify output from a function: 

<CodeBlock lang="ts" filename="sum.ts" code={
`export function sum(a: number, b: number) { 
    return a + b 
}`
} />

<CodeBlock lang="ts" filename="sum.test.ts" code={
`import { expect, it } from 'vitest'
import { sum } from './sum.ts'

it('should return 3 when adding 1 and 2', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)
})`
} />
