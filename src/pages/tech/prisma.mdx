# Prisma ORM

## Introduction

**Prisma** is a next-generation Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that provides a type-safe and auto-generated query builder specifically designed for Node.js & TypeScript. It also includes a robust migration system and a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to view and edit their database seamlessly.

## Why Prisma?

Prisma offers several advantages that make it a compelling choice for developers:

1. **Type Safety**: With Prisma, you get type-safe database queries, which means that errors can be caught at compile time rather than runtime. This leads to more robust and maintainable code.

2. **Auto-Generated Queries**: Prisma automatically generates queries based on your data model, reducing the amount of boilerplate code you need to write and allowing you to focus on your application logic.

3. **Migration System**: Prisma includes a powerful migration system that helps you manage your database schema changes easily. You can track changes, roll back migrations, and ensure your database is always in sync with your application.

4. **Graphical User Interface**: The Prisma Studio provides a user-friendly interface to interact with your database. You can view, edit, and manage your data without writing any SQL queries, making it accessible for developers and non-developers alike.

5. **Cross-Database Support**: Prisma supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server, allowing you to choose the best database for your application without being locked into a specific technology.

6. **Community and Ecosystem**: Prisma has a vibrant community and a rich ecosystem of plugins and tools that enhance its functionality, making it easier to integrate with other technologies and frameworks.

By leveraging these features, Prisma simplifies database management and enhances developer productivity, making it an excellent choice for modern web applications.


## Prisma Client

The **@prisma/client** package is a type-safe database client for Node.js and TypeScript, providing an intuitive API for CRUD operations and complex queries. It auto-generates based on your Prisma schema, ensuring type alignment with your database, which improves error detection and enhances developer productivity.

## Schema

The schema section in Prisma defines your data model, including entities, fields, and relationships. It allows Prisma to auto-generate database migrations and the **@prisma/client** API, ensuring type safety and consistency between your application and the database. 

By default, your schemas will located at <Code>/prisma/schema.prisma</Code>
