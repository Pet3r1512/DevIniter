In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, developers face the challenge of rapidly adapting to new technologies and tools. DevIniter was created to simplify this process by providing a curated collection of open-source starter templates that enable developers to kickstart their projects with ease.

At DevIniter, we understand that time is a precious resource. That’s why our mission is to empower developers—both seasoned professionals and newcomers—by offering ready-to-use templates that cover a variety of tech stacks. Whether you're building a personal project, a startup, or experimenting with new ideas, our templates are designed to minimize setup time and maximize productivity.


## Package Managers Support

Currently, our platform supports **Node.js v20**, **pnpm v9**, and **npm v10**. We are actively working to expand compatibility with additional package managers to offer broader support and flexibility.


## Frameworks Support

Currently, we primarily support **TypeScript** with following Frameworks and Build Tools:

- [**Next.js** (Page Router)](https://nextjs.org/)
- [**Vite** (React)](https://vitejs.dev/)

As we grow, we plan to expand our support for additional frameworks to provide developers with even more options and flexibility in their projects.

## Future Plans

To expand our support for additional languages, frameworks, and build tools, we are excited to share that our next focus areas will include:

- [**Astro**](https://astro.build/)
- [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/)
