In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, developers face the challenge of rapidly adapting to new technologies and tools. DevIniter was created to simplify this process by providing a curated collection of open-source starter templates that enable developers to kickstart their projects with ease.

At DevIniter, we understand that time is a precious resource. That’s why our mission is to empower developers—both seasoned professionals and newcomers—by offering ready-to-use templates that cover a variety of tech stacks. Whether you're building a personal project, a startup, or experimenting with new ideas, our templates are designed to minimize setup time and maximize productivity.


## Package Managers Support

Currently, our platform supports **Node.js v20**, **pnpm v9**, and **npm v10**. We are actively working to expand compatibility with additional package managers to offer broader support and flexibility.


## Frameworks Support

Currently, we primarily support **TypeScript** with following Frameworks and Build Tools:

- <HighlightedText content={{href: "https://nextjs.org/", text: "Next.js - Page Router", target: "_blank"}} />
- <HighlightedText content={{href: "https://vitejs.dev/", text: "Vite - React.js", target: "_blank"}} />

As we grow, we plan to expand our support for additional frameworks to provide developers with even more options and flexibility in their projects.

## Future Plans

To expand our support for additional languages, frameworks, and build tools, we are excited to share that our next focus areas will include:

- <HighlightedText content={{href: "https://astro.build/", text: "Astro", target: "_blank"}} />
- <HighlightedText content={{href: "https://expressjs.com/", text: "Express.js", target: "_blank"}} />
