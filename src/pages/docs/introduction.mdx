# Why DevIniter?

## The Problems

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, web development has gained immense popularity, fueled by the constant emergence of new technologies and tools. Developers often find themselves grappling with the complexities of initiating a new project while juggling various tech stacks.

As a web developer, I engage in extensive self-learning, yet each time I embark on a new project, I spend considerable time preparing the basic tech stack. This challenge has led to the creation of numerous starter templates aimed at streamlining the development process, allowing developers to launch their products more quickly.

However, many of these templates are designed for personal use and remain obscure to the wider developer community, particularly newcomers who may feel overwhelmed when starting their first projects.

<strong>DevIniter</strong> seeks to centralize these templates into one accessible platform, transforming them into open-source resources for a broader audience. We also encourage developers to contribute their own templates, fostering a collaborative environment that connects them with other talented developers in the community.
