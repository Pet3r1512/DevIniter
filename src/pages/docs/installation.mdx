# Installation

To get started with DevIniter templates, please follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) (version 9)

<strong>Note:</strong> We are actively working to expand support for additional Node.js and PNPM versions, as well as other package managers such as NPM and Yarn.

## Initializing Your Project with DevIniter Templates

To install one of our templates, run the following command:

<InstallBlock command={[
    {
      value: "pnpm",
      script: "pnpx deviniter@latest",
    },
    {
      value: "npm",
      script: "npx deviniter@latest",
    },
  ]} />

During the installation, you will encounter the following prompts:

<QuestionBlock />

    "Once the prompts above are complete, all dependencies will be installed automatically."

## Starting Your Project

After successfully installing your selected template, navigate to the project directory by running:

<ScriptBlock script={
    {command: "cd",
    content: "dev-app"}
}/>

Then, start the project locally with one of the following commands:

<InstallBlock command={
    [
        {
            value: "pnpm",
            script: "pnpm dev"
        },
        {
            value: "npm",
            script: "npm run dev"
        },
    ]
}/>

If there is no other application running on port 3000, your project will start at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
