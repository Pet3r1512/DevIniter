# Installation

To get started with DevIniter templates, please follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- <HighlightedText content={{href: "https://nodejs.org/", text: "Nodejs", target: "_blank" }} /> (version 20)
- <HighlightedText content={{href: "https://pnpm.io/", text: "pnpm", target: "_blank" }} /> (version 9)
- <HighlightedText content={{href: "https://www.npmjs.com/", text: "pnpm", target: "_blank" }} /> (version 10)

<strong>Note:</strong> We are actively working to expand support for additional Node.js, pnpm and npm versions, as well as other package managers such as Yarn.

## Scaffolding Template

We recommend starting a new template using `deviniter`, which downloads template for you automatically. To install a template, run:

<ScriptBlock script={
    {command: "npx",
    content: "@deviniter/cli@latest"}
}/>

During the installation, you will encounter the following prompts:

<QuestionBlock />

If youâ€™re new to DevIniter, refer to our <HighlightedText content={{href: "/docs/template_structure", text: "Template Structure"}} /> guide for a comprehensive overview and to enhance your experience with our templates.

## Installing Dependencies

After successfully scaffolded your favorite template, you need to install all dependencies by running:

<InstallBlock command={[
    {
      value: "pnpm",
      script: "pnpm install",
    },
    {
      value: "npm",
      script: "npm install",
    },
  ]} />

## Starting Your Project

Now, you need to navigate to your project:

<ScriptBlock script={
    {command: "cd",
    content: "dev-app"}
}/>

Then, start the project locally with one of the following commands:

<InstallBlock command={
    [
        {
            value: "pnpm",
            script: "pnpm dev"
        },
        {
            value: "npm",
            script: "npm run dev"
        },
    ]
}/>

If there is no other application running on port 3000, your project will start at <HighlightedText content={{href: "http://localhost:3000", text: "localhost:3000", target: "_blank"}} />.
